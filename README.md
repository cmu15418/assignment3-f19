# Assignment 3: Fast N-Body Simulation

In this assignment, we will implement an approximate N-Body simulation and parallelize it on Xeon-Phi. In physics and astronomy, an N-body simulation is a simulation of a dynamical system of particles, usually under the influence of physical forces, such as gravity (see n-body problem).
